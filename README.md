# üçÖ Tomato Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that detects and classifies diseases in tomato leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to help farmers and agricultural experts identify plant diseases early and accurately to minimize crop loss and improve productivity.



## üöÄ Project Overview

Tomato plants are highly susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly affect yield and quality. This project uses a CNN-based machine learning model to classify tomato leaf images into different disease categories (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight, Septoria, and healthy leaves).

The model was trained using a labeled image dataset of tomato leaves and achieved high accuracy by leveraging data augmentation, proper preprocessing, and deep learning techniques. All model training and evaluation were done using **Google Colab** for convenience and scalability.
